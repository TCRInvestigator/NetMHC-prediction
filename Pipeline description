Step 1: mutation selection
  Input: WGS output
  Process:
  --> Filter for exonic nonsynonymous variants
  --> Filter out polymorphisms from dbSNP (build 150)
  --> Subtract same mutations (defined as same “AAChange”) from paired PBMCs
  Output: filtered mutation excel file

Step 2: epitope generation
  Input: “AAChange” from Step 1 output
  Process:
  -->
