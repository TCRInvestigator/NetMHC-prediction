Step 1: mutation selection
  Input: WGS output
  Process:
  --> Filter for exonic nonsynonymous variants
  --> Filter out polymorphisms from dbSNP (build 150)
  --> Subtract same mutations (defined as same “AAChange”) from paired PBMCs
  Output: filtered mutation excel file

Step 2: epitope generation
  Input: “AAChange” from Step 1 output
  Process:
  --> Obtain gene, transcript ID, nucleotide change and protein change from "AAChange"
  --> Get all transcript ID versions from NCBI
  --> Fetch protein sequences according to versioned transcript IDs from NCBI
  --> Find the matched version of transcript ID by verifying the protein sequence at the mutation position (the first match is selected)
  ---------------------------
  For SNVs
    --> Apply protein changes to fetched protein sequences to generate mutated protein sequences
    --> Generate 9-mer peptides containing the mutation position from both WT and mutated protein sequences (9 WT peptides and 9 mutated peptides for each SNV)
  ---------------------------
  For Indels
    --> Fetch mRNA sequences using the selected versioned transcript ID
    --> Find start codon by translating from each "ATG" and verify the translated protein sequence with fetched protein sequence (the first match is selected)
    --> Trim mRNA sequences to the start codon
    --> Apply nucleotide changes to trimmed mRNA sequences to generate mutated mRNA sequences
    --> Translate mutated mRNA sequences to mutated protein sequences
    --> Generate 9-mer peptides covering full-length WT and mutated protein sequences
    --> Filter out duplicated peptides and keep only peptides unique to mutated protein sequences
  ---------------------------
  Output: fasta files containing 9-mer peptides

Step 3: NetMHC prediction
  Input: Step 2 output, patient HLA allele information
  Process: Use NetMHCpan - 4.1 to predict peptides' elution ranks to the patient's HLA alleles 
  Output: Excel containing prediction results for all HLA alleles

Step 4: Filter for HLA binders
  Input: Step 3 output
  Process:
  --> Filter for peptides with EL_rank < 0.5 (strong binders) or EL_rank < 2 (both weak and strong binders)
  ---------------------------
  For SNVs
    --> Filter out mutated peptides whose WT peptide counterparts have EL_rank < 2
  ---------------------------
  Output: Excel containing HLA binding 9-mer peptides
