Run each script one by one.

Before running script 4, manually open the NetMHC output .xls file and save as .txt.

Then run script 4 by: `python 4.Format_NetMHC_output.py [NetMHCpan_output].txt [epitope_generation_output].fasta [formatted_output].xlsx`

Two unsure things about this pipeline: 1) whether the mutation filtering script works accurately 2)Number of peptides descrease after formatting for unkown reason
